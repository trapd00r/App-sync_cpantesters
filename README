NAME
    App::sync_cpantesters - Sync CPAN testers failure reports to local
    directories

VERSION
    version 1.110730

SYNOPSIS
        # sync_cpantesters -a MARCEL -d ~/dev/cpan-testers

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN testers provide a valuable service. The reports are available on
    the Web - for example, for CPAN ID "MARCEL", the reports are at
    <http://cpantesters.perl.org/author/MARCEL.html>. I don't like to read
    them in the browser and click on each individual failure report. I also
    don't look at the success reports. I'd rather download the failure
    reports and read them in my favorite editor, vim. I want to be able to
    run this program repeatedly and only download new failure reports, as
    well as delete old ones that no longer appear in the master list -
    probably because a new version of the distribution in question was
    uploaded.

    If you are in the same position, then this program might be for you.

    You need to pass a base directory using the "--dir" options. For each
    distribution for which there are failure reports, a directory is
    created. Each failure report is stored in a file within that
    subdirectory. The HTML is converted to plain text. For example, at one
    point in time, I ran the program using:

        sync_cpantesters -a MARCEL -d reports

    and the directory structure created looked like this:

        reports/Aspect-0.12/449224
        reports/Attribute-Memoize-0.01/39824
        reports/Attribute-Memoize-0.01/71010
        reports/Attribute-Overload-0.04/700557
        reports/Attribute-TieClasses-0.03/700575
        reports/Attribute-Util-1.02/455076
        reports/Attribute-Util-1.02/475237
        reports/Attribute-Util-1.02/477578
        reports/Attribute-Util-1.02/485231
        reports/Attribute-Util-1.02/489218
        ...

FUNCTIONS
  run
    The main function, which is called by the "sync_cpantesters" program.

  usage
    Displays the program's usage information.

  get
    Takes a URL, downloads and returns the contents. A progress bar is
    displayed during the download.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
    "--author" <cpanid>, "-a" <cpanid>
        The CPAN ID for which you want to download CPAN testers results. In
        my case, this id is "MARCEL".

        You have to use exactly one of "--author" or "--uri".

    "--uri" <uri>, "-u" <uri>
        The URI from which to download the CPAN testers results. It needs to
        be in the same format as, say,
        <http://cpantesters.perl.org/author/MARCEL.html>. You might want to
        use this option if you've already downloaded the relevant file; in
        this case, use a "file://" URI.

        You have to use exactly one of "--author" or "--uri".

    "--dir" <dir>, "-d" <dir>
        The directory you want to download the reports to. This can be a
        relative or absolute path. This argument is mandatory.

    "--ignore" <regex>, "-i" <regex>
        If this argument is given, then every distribution whose name
        matches this regular expression is ignored. You might use this when
        you have deprecated distributions that you don't care about anymore,
        but the reports are still there.

    "--verbose", "-v"
        Be more verbose.

    "--help", "-h"
        Show this documentation.
